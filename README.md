# Together
I believe that everyone should be able to have access to knowledge for free. Sometimes producing quality material can be expensive, and so, in turn, people who can't afford the final product end up losing access to information. This platform aims to be a place to share any knowledge you have with the rest of the world, having the whole planet to review what you write.

It takes the idea behind open source code and Git and applies it to producing articles and tutorials. Start something and let other people help you producing a great article about **anything**. <br />
Found something wrong in someone else's article? Fork the article, fix it and send a pull request. The original article will get better and better.<br />
Think you can take from where an article stopped and create more useful information? Fork the article and people who read the original article will know where to go from there.

## Main Goals
- Categories and tags to posts just like in a blog to help people find what you write.
- Centralized comments can provide greater feedback, everyone will be reviewing and talking about the same article.
- Vote on the best version of the article. Sometimes just changing the order of something can help people understand it more easily.
- Some article is outdated? Don't worry, as soon as a new version comes up and gets enough voting, it will automatically replace the outdated article as the "best version".
- Want to start learning something new? Start doing a search on Together. You may find dozens of different articles from various perspectives and aimed at different levels of knowledge.

## Collaborate
Share the same vision on how knowledge should be distributed? Help us build it! <br />
Right now the code is just designed to show how the idea works. There's nothing set in stone, not even the language chosen. If you think you can help in any other way than coding, contact me via email or even open an issue.
